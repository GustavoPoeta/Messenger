# Message
This is a simple messenger app that tries to recreate the foundation of Discord and WhatsApp Web.

## Tech
It was entirely built in React VITE (in the frontend), and in the backend: nodeJS.
Axios (frontend), and express, cors, bcrypt were used.
The database was built in mysql, locally.

## Warning
It could be deployed in the real world, but have in mind that this isn't german engineering,
so performance issues are to be expected. 

Feel free to improve, use, modify it!
