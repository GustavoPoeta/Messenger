# Message
This is a simple messenger app that tries to recreate the foundation of Discord and WhatsApp Web.

## Tech
It was entirely built in React VITE (in the frontend), and in the backend: nodeJS.
Axios (frontend), and express, bcrypt were used.
The DataBase was built in mysql, locally.

## Warning
It could be deployed in the real world, but have in mind that this isn't german engineering,
so performance issues are to be expected. 

## How to run
Clone the repository, and open the terminal first in the backend folder: type "npm run dev" to run the api.
And do the same in the messenger folder.
Remember, this project uses a DataBase, you must have it imported and running, locally or not.

## Finally 
Feel free to improve, use, modify it!
